          Keith S. Grybowski is the elected Charleston County School Board Trustee for District 1 (Mount Pleasant) and a
          30-year resident of Mount Pleasant. A lifelong advocate for public education, he recently retired (for the third time).
          He spent 15 years at Patriots Point Naval &amp; Maritime Museum as Director of Education, developing hands-on, interactive
          learning experiences used by schools across South Carolina.
          <br/><br/>
          Through continued nonprofit work with ECMSP and statewide classroom partnerships, he has helped serve more than a million
          students over three decades.

        Keith created and contributed to the widely distributed <em>Harry I Was, Oscar I Am</em> reading series, with more than
        500,000 copies placed in students’ hands—reflecting the belief that literacy, relevance, and student motivation are the
        foundation of achievement.
        <br/><br/>
        Before education, he worked as a trial and corporate attorney and founded businesses in technology and worldwide shipping.
        That experience strengthens his approach to governance, accountability, and fiscal stewardship.
        <br/><br/>
        As a Trustee, he focuses on the Board’s core duties: hiring and evaluating the Superintendent, approving budgets, adopting
        curriculum, and setting policy direction. As Board Policy Liaison, he is working with staff on responsible use of AI.
        As the Board Representative with the District’s new Foundation, he helps raise additional support for student growth.
